                <p class="summary">The story begins with Piyali Roy, an American marine biologist of Indian descent, arriving in the Sundarbans to study the rare Irrawaddy dolphins. Her journey brings her into contact with two other key characters: Kanai Dutt, a Delhi-based translator visiting his aunt Nilima, and Fokir, an illiterate but knowledgeable local fisherman.</p>
                <p class="summary">Piya hires Fokir to help her navigate the waterways in search of the dolphins. Despite the language barrier, they develop a mutual respect and understanding through their shared experiences in the harsh but beautiful environment. Kanai, on the other hand, is initially skeptical about Piya's mission but gradually becomes more involved as he discovers a manuscript written by his deceased uncle, Nirmal, which reveals the historical and political turmoil of the region.</p>
                <p class="summary">The narrative delves into the ecological threats facing the Sundarbans, the struggles of its inhabitants, and the tragic history of the Morichjhanpi massacre, where refugees were forcefully evicted from the islands. Ghosh intertwines these themes with the personal journeys of the characters, creating a rich tapestry of human and environmental interconnectedness.</p>
